Data-Driven-Hackathon-Blood-Donation-
Goal is to predict the target variable, whether he/she donated blood in March 2007. You are provided the following set of information about the dataset:

Months since Last Donation: this is the number of monthis since this donor's most recent donation.
Number of Donations: this is the total number of donations that the donor has made.
Total Volume Donated: this is the total amound of blood that the donor has donated in cubuc centimeters.
Months since First Donation: this is the number of months since the donor's first donation.

Evaluation Metric
Log loss =−1n∑ni=1[yilog(y^i)+(1−yi)log(1−y^i)]

The metric used for this competition is logarithmic loss. y^ is the probability that y=1. Logarithmic loss provides a steep penalty for predictions that are both confident and wrong. The goal is to minimize the log loss.
